## ‚ö° Quick Local Setup

For experienced users familiar with Node.js, Rust, and SpacetimeDB. See detailed sections below for troubleshooting or authentication specifics.

**0. Install SpacetimeDB CLI:**
Follow the instructions for your OS: [https://spacetimedb.com/install](https://spacetimedb.com/install)
(e.g., `curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh` on macOS/Linux)

**1. Clone & Install Client Deps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinktidevibes/2D-Survival-Multiplayer-Game.git
cd 2D-Survival-Multiplayer-Game
npm install
```

**2. Setup & Run Auth Server (Terminal 1):**
```bash
# Ensure OpenSSL is installed (https://www.openssl.org/source/)

# From the project root directory, create a 'keys' directory:
mkdir keys

# Generate RSA private and public key files inside the 'keys' directory:
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in keys/private.pem -out keys/public.pem

# Navigate to the auth server directory and run it:
cd auth-server-openauth/
npm install
npm start
# Keep this terminal running (Auth Server on http://localhost:4001)
```

**3. Run SpacetimeDB Server (Terminal 2):**
```bash
# In project root directory
spacetime start
# Keep this terminal running (SpacetimeDB Server)
```

**4. Publish Server & Generate Bindings (Terminal 3):**
```bash
cd server/
# Optional: Clean previous DB state if needed
# spacetime delete vibe-survival-game
spacetime publish vibe-survival-game
spacetime spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .
cd ..
```

**5. Run Client Dev Server (Terminal 3 or 4):**
```bash
# In project root directory
npm run dev
# Access game at http://localhost:3008 (or similar)
```
*   **For Multiplayer Testing:** Open a **new terminal** in the project root and run `npm run dev` again. The second client will likely open on a different port (e.g., 3009). Open this URL in a separate browser tab or window.

**Updating Server Code:**
*   **Logic Change Only:** `cd server && spacetime publish vibe-survival-game`
*   **Schema Change (Tables/Reducers):**
    1.  `(Optional but Recommended)` `spacetime delete vibe-survival-game` (Run *before* publish to prevent schema conflicts).
    2.  `cd server`
    3.  `spacetime publish vibe-survival-game`
    4.  `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .`
    5.  `cd ..`

## üîê Authentication Setup

This project implements user authentication using a custom Node.js authentication server built with OpenAuthJS and Hono, bridged to SpacetimeDB via standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWTs.

**Approach:**

1.  **Client:** Initiates an OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, manually constructing the `/authorize` URL for the custom auth server and specifying `acr_values=pwd` to request the password flow.
2.  **Auth Server (`auth-server-openauth/`):** A Node.js/Hono server that:
    *   Intercepts the `/authorize` request.
    *   If `acr_values=pwd`, redirects the user to custom HTML login/registration forms, forwarding OIDC parameters (`client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `state`, `code_challenge`, etc.).
    *   Handles POST submissions from these forms, verifying user credentials against a local user store (`data/users.json`).
    *   On successful login/registration, generates a one-time authorization `code` and stores it along with the user ID and PKCE challenge.
    *   Redirects the user back to the client's specified `redirect_uri` with the `code` and `state`.
3.  **Client:** Receives the redirect at its `/callback` URI, extracts the `code`.
4.  **Client:** Makes a `fetch` POST request to the auth server's custom `/token` endpoint, sending the `code`, PKCE `code_verifier`, `client_id`, and `redirect_uri`.
5.  **Auth Server (`/token`):**
    *   Receives the code exchange request.
    *   Looks up the code, retrieves the associated user ID and PKCE challenge.
    *   Verifies the `code_verifier` against the stored `code_challenge`.
    *   If valid, mints a new JWT `id_token` and `access_token`, signed using a **private RSA key** (RS256 algorithm).
    *   Returns the tokens to the client.
6.  **Client:** Receives the tokens, stores the `id_token` (used as the `spacetimeToken`).
7.  **Client:** Connects to the main SpacetimeDB game server (`server/`) using the `id_token`.
8.  **SpacetimeDB Server (`server/`):**
    *   Configured with the `issuer` URL of the auth server.
    *   Fetches the OIDC discovery document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) and then the public keys (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) from the auth server.
    *   Verifies the `id_token`'s signature using the fetched public key and validates the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims.
    *   Grants the connection access based on the identity (`sub` claim) in the validated token.

This approach uses standard OIDC practices with asymmetric key signing (RS256), allowing SpacetimeDB to securely verify tokens without needing a shared secret.

### Running Authentication Locally

To get authentication working during local development, follow these steps:

1.  **Generate RSA Keys:** You need an RSA key pair for signing and verifying tokens. Use OpenSSL:
    *   Open a terminal in the **project root** directory.
    *   Run the following commands:
        ```bash
        # Create a directory for keys if it doesn't exist
        mkdir keys
        # Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
        # Extract the public key from the private key
        openssl rsa -pubout -in keys/private.pem -out keys/public.pem
        ```
    *   This creates `keys/private.pem` (keep secret, used by auth server) and `keys/public.pem` (used for verification).
    *   **Important:** The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent these keys from being committed to Git.

2.  **Configure Auth Server (`auth-server-openauth/`):**
    *   No `.env` file is strictly required for basic local operation, as defaults are set in `index.ts`.
    *   The server automatically loads `keys/private.pem` and `keys/public.pem` for signing tokens and serving the JWKS endpoint.
    *   It manages user data in `data/users.json` (which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist). The `.gitignore` also prevents this file from being committed.

3.  **Run Auth Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `auth-server-openauth/` directory.
    *   Run `npm install` if you haven't already.
    *   Run `npm start`.
    *   Keep this terminal running. You should see `üöÄ Auth server ‚Üí http://localhost:4001`. Logs for authentication steps will appear here.

4.  **Configure SpacetimeDB Server (`server/data/config.toml`):**
    *   Ensure the `server/data/config.toml` file has the following `[auth]` configuration to trust your auth server:
        ```toml
        [auth]
        [[identity_provider]]
        type     = "oidc"
        issuer   = "http://localhost:4001"       # URL of our OpenAuth server
        jwks_uri = "http://localhost:4001/.well-known/jwks.json" # Explicitly point to the JWKS endpoint
        audience = "vibe-survival-game-client" # Must match 'aud' claim in tokens
        ```

5.  **Run Main SpacetimeDB Server (`server/`):**
    *   Open a **separate terminal**.
    *   Run `spacetime start`.
    *   Keep this terminal running.

6.  **Client Configuration:** No changes are needed in the client code. `AuthContext.tsx` is configured to use the auth server at `http://localhost:4001`.

7.  **Run Client:**
    *   Open a terminal in the project **root** directory.
    *   Run `npm run dev`.

Now, when you sign in via the client's login screen, the full authentication flow using your custom OpenAuthJS server and RS256 keys should execute.

### Production Deployment

*   **Auth Server:** Deploy the `auth-server-openauth` Node.js application to a hosting provider. Ensure the `keys/private.pem` and `keys/public.pem` files are securely deployed alongside the application (or manage keys via environment variables/secrets management if your host supports it). Ensure it's served over HTTPS.
*   **Client:** Update `AUTH_SERVER_URL` in `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to point to your *deployed* auth server URL (using HTTPS).
*   **SpacetimeDB:** Configure your SpacetimeDB Maincloud/Enterprise instance with the *production* `issuer` and `jwks_uri` of your deployed auth server, and the correct `audience`.

### Limitations & Future Improvements

*   **Basic Forms:** The login/register forms served by the auth server are very basic HTML. They could be enhanced or replaced with a proper frontend framework if desired.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling in the manual auth routes could be more user-friendly.
*   **No Refresh Token Handling:** This setup doesn't implement refresh tokens. If the `id_token` expires, the user would need to log in again.

## üìú Cursor Rules & Code Maintainability

### Cursor Rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

This project utilizes [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)'s AI features, including **Rules**, to aid development. Rules are markdown files (`.mdc`) that provide context and guidelines to the AI assistant.
*   `guide.mdc`: Contains general architectural guidelines, technology choices, and development workflow information.
*   `resources.mdc`: Outlines the specific steps for adding new resources or gatherable nodes consistently.

As the project grows, more specific rules will be added for core features (e.g., crafting, building, combat) to ensure the AI can provide consistent and relevant assistance.

### Code Maintainability

While the project is still evolving, a key goal is maintainability. As features are added, we aim to:
*   Keep individual file sizes manageable (ideally under ~600 lines where practical).
*   Refactor logic into reusable helper functions and potentially dedicated modules (like the planned `inventory_logic.rs`).
*   Utilize abstraction to avoid code duplication, especially for common interactions like container management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Client Configuration

### Game Parameters (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`)

This file centralizes client-side values needed primarily for rendering the game world. 
The server uses its own authoritative values for game logic. Modifying these client values only affects local visuals.

*   `tileSize`: Visual pixel size for grid tiles.
*   `worldWidth`, `worldHeight`: Visual dimensions of the world grid (in tiles).
*   `spriteWidth`, `spriteHeight`: Pixel dimensions of a single sprite frame for rendering.

### SpacetimeDB Connection (`client/src/App.tsx`)

To connect the client to your SpacetimeDB instance, configure the following constants near the top of `client/src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
const SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS = 'ws://localhost:3000';
const SPACETIME_DB_NAME = 'vibe-survival-game';
```

*   **For Local Development:** Use the default values (`ws://localhost:3000` and your module name).
*   **For Maincloud Deployment:** Replace `SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS` with your Maincloud WebSocket URI (e.g., `wss://maincloud.spacetimedb.net`) and `SPACETIME_DB_NAME` with your Maincloud database name (e.g., `your-identity/your-database-name`).

## üåç World Configuration (Tile Size & Map Dimensions)

Changing the tile size or the overall world dimensions requires modifications in **both** the client and server code to ensure consistency between rendering, collision detection, and game logic.

1.  **Client (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`):**
    *   Modify the `TILE_SIZE` constant at the top of the file.
    *   Modify the `worldWidth` and `worldHeight` properties within the exported `gameConfig` object (these define dimensions in *tiles*).
    *   Other values like `minimapGridCellDiagonalTiles` might also need tuning depending on the new world size.

2.  **Server (`server/src/lib.rs`):**
    *   Modify the `TILE_SIZE_PX` constant.
    *   Modify the `WORLD_WIDTH_TILES` constant.
    *   Modify the `WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES` constant.

**Important:** Ensure the `TILE_SIZE` / `TILE_SIZE_PX` and the `worldWidth`/`Height` / `WORLD_WIDTH`/`HEIGHT_TILES` values are kept consistent between the client and server configuration files.

After making server-side changes, remember to **re-publish** the module:

```bash
# From the server/ directory
spacetime publish vibe-survival-game
# No need to regenerate client bindings for changing only these constants
```

## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

This guide assumes you have installed the prerequisites: Node.js v22+, Rust, and the SpacetimeDB CLI.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thinktidevibes/2D-Survival-Multiplayer-Game.git
    cd 2D-Survival-Multiplayer-Game
    ```

2.  **Install Client Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # From the project root directory
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start Local SpacetimeDB Server:**
    Open a **separate terminal** window and run:
    ```bash
    spacetime start
    ```
    Keep this terminal running in the background. It hosts your local game database.

4.  **Build, Publish Server Module & Generate Client Bindings:**
    Open **another terminal** window, navigate to the `server` directory, and run these commands:
    ```bash
    cd server
    spacetime publish vibe-survival-game
    spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated
    ```
    *   **Note:** You need to re-run these two commands *every time* you change the server schema (e.g., modify tables or reducers in `server/src/lib.rs` or other `.rs` files).

5.  **Run the Client:**
    In the **same terminal** as step 4 (or a new one, just make sure you are in the project root directory `2D-Survival-Multiplayer-Game`), run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Access the Game:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

## üîß Troubleshooting Local Setup

*   **`Cannot find module './generated'` error in client:**
    *   Ensure you ran `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .` from the `server` directory *after* the last `spacetime publish` was **successful**. Check the publish output for errors.
    *   Make sure the `client/src/generated` folder was actually created and contains `.ts` files, including `index.ts`.
    *   Restart the Vite dev server (`npm run dev`). Sometimes Vite needs a restart after significant file changes.
*   **Client connects but game doesn't load / players don't appear:**
    *   Check the browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors (e.g., subscription failures, rendering issues).
    *   Check the terminal running `spacetime start` for server-side Rust errors (e.g., reducer panics, assertion failures).
*   **Old players/data still appearing after disconnect/refresh:**
    *   Verify the `identity_disconnected` logic in `server/src/lib.rs` is correctly deleting the player, inventory, and equipment.
    *   For a guaranteed clean slate during development, delete and recreate the local database:
        ```bash
        # Stop spacetime start (Ctrl+C in its terminal)
        spacetime delete vibe-survival-game # Run from any directory
        spacetime start # Restart the server
        # Then re-publish and re-generate (Step 4 above)
        ```
*   **`spacetime publish` tries to publish to Maincloud instead of local:**
    *   Ensure you are logged out: `spacetime logout`.
    *   Ensure the `spacetime start` server is running *before* you publish.
    *   Check your SpacetimeDB config file (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/SpacetimeDB/config/cli.toml` on Windows, `~/.local/share/spacetime/config/cli.toml` on Linux/macOS) and make sure `default_server` is set to `local` or commented out.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1.  **Server Development (`server/src`)**:
    *   Modify Rust code (add features, fix bugs).
    *   **If schema changes (tables, reducer signatures):**
        1.  Run `spacetime publish vibe-survival-game` (from `server/`).
        2.  Run `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .` (from `server/`).
    *   **If only logic changes (no schema impact):**
        1.  Run `spacetime publish vibe-survival-game` (from `server/`). (Generate is not strictly needed but doesn't hurt).
2.  **Client Development (`client/src`)**:
    *   Modify React/TypeScript code.
    *   The Vite dev server (`npm run dev`) usually provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast updates. If things seem broken after large changes, try restarting the dev server.
